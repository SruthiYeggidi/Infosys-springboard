This repository has all the Python tasks and assignments from the Infosys Springboard Internship. It includes the tasks completed so far. Each task helps build basic skills in Machine Learning, NLP, and Data Analysis using Python.

**About the Repository**
This repository contains the tasks I completed during my internship. Each notebook shows basic data science steps such as
Data loading and exploration
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF
Model training and evaluation
Performance comparison of ML models
